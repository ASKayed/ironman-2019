The triathlon is arguably one of the most extreme and mentally taxing endurance sport competitions. Athletes train for years to complete the one-day competition consisting of a 2.4-mile (3.86 km) swim, a 112-mile (180.25 km) bicycle ride and a marathon 26.22-mile (42.20 km) run, raced in that order. Because a traithlon has three separate endurance sports, it begs the question, what type of athlete is best at triathlons? Additional questions of value are, what country breeds the best traithlon athletes? What comprises a strong Ironman athlete?

Every year since 1978, the World's craziest endurance athletes compete in the Kona Ironman World Championship (2020 being a COVID-exception). My goal is to explore the 2019 Ironman World Championship Results to determine if athletes hailing from specific backgrounds are more likely to perform well in an Ironman triathlon.

If time allows, I will web scrape for 2018, 2017, and 2016 results to explore similar questions.
